# RISC-V Implementation Folder

This directory is for keeping source files that is utilized in implementation of RISC-V soft-core onto FPGA.  

*Note: This attempt has been deprecated, due to heavy workload of constructing customized instructions and generating CNN model. However, it is proposed for future work, where RISC-V implementation will enable any FPGAs to function, plus RISC-V machines to adopt this acclerator as ASIC design.
